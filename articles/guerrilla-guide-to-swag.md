#The Guerrilla Guide to Swag

As a firm believer in the Mozilla Mission: "an open web, free and accessible to all", there are some things that can further that mission, among them swag. Swag are physical objects: stickers, pins, plushies, toys, posters and other objects which help promote this Mission. But swag has been getting rather scarce in recent times, lacking even for events with official Mozilla participation. This appears to be a Mozilla-wide issue.

Why this scarcity of swag? We can only speculate...

Swag is indeed a precious thing, but people may take it for granted. To understand where swag comes from, we need to look into the story of it.

Swag isn't just the physical items, to be truly swag, an object needs to be infused with the spirit of the Fox. There are only a limited number of foxes within Mozilla that can lend their spirit to the current swag stockpile, so swag is limited in that sense.

Swag also takes a long time to travel from its place of birth (China) and to the hands of eager Mozillians. It's a complicated logistical procedure which involves (among other things): prayers to the Great Fox, perilous oceanic voyages and also sacrifice (eating of) fox-shaped cookies by the Reps Council. As for the trend nowadays, Reps Council is committed to only organic, GM-free, fair-trade fox cookies. They are delicious, but also scarce.

Therefore, I propose Mozillians help themselves and each other to solve this critical scarcity of swag.

How can you do it?

**Print your own.** The simplest kinds are square stickers (colored or black and white). I already have some vector or raster images at various resolution if you need them. You can manually cut a reasonable numbers of stickers using a pane of glass, a sharp cutting blade and a straight edge. You can also use a hobby knife and a cutting board to preserve the sharpness of the cutting blade. If you plan to print larger numbers (200-1000), then you may be able to find a paper guillotine in one of your local print shops.

Circular stickers can also be made with a manual process by purchasing a special circle cutter from a paper supplies store. Those circles come in pre-determined size and the process of cutting is a little more involved (more time-consuming), but the effect looks definitely better.

If you have access to a cutter-plotter in your locality, you can also cut arbitrary shapes, out of either sticker paper of vinyl. Vinyl is more expensive and harder to cut, but lasts longer and is waterproof.

**Make your own.** Many print shops can make pins, t-shirts, mugs and other promotional items. Investigate on your own, you may be surprised at how cheap these can be.

The ultimate level is 3D printing. If you live in a town with a local hacker space, get in touch with them. 3D printing has nearly limitless possibilities, but of course at a much greater cost. Nevertheless, it becomes possible to have unique event-related items on demand.

**Get in touch**

Mozillians don't need to work alone. If you know of another Mozilla group in your vicinity (or next country over) -- do get in touch to investigate the possibilities of asking for help. Swag is a fundamental component of spreading the Mission and its scarcity is completely unjustified if we are willing to fabricate some of it. The Fox helps those who help themselves.
